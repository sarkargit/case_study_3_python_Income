Data Analysis and Preprocessing Project
Description
This project involves performing data analysis and data preprocessing on a dataset containing demographic and occupational information. The primary goal is to clean the data, explore key insights, and address specific questions related to the dataset. By performing data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the dataset is prepared for potential future machine learning tasks.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to clean, explore, and analyze a dataset containing demographic data and income information. Below are the key questions and tasks performed during the project:

Data Inspection: Exploring the top and bottom rows of the dataset, checking its shape, and analyzing a random sample of the data.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns, followed by transforming certain features for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of features, the relationships between them, and identifying any patterns or anomalies.
Feature Engineering: Modifying columns to improve their suitability for modeling, such as encoding categorical variables or removing unnecessary features.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigating the relationship between two variables (e.g., age vs. salary, education vs. salary).
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas: A library used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
Matplotlib: A library for creating visualizations and plotting graphs.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment used for running code, visualizing data, and documenting the process.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains demographic and occupational data with the following key attributes:

age: The age of the individual.
workclass: The type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-Employed, etc.).
education: The highest level of education attained (e.g., Bachelors, Masters, etc.).
salary: Whether the individual earns more than 50K annually (binary classification: <=50K or >50K).
occupation: The occupation of the individual.
marital-status, race, sex, hours-per-week: Other relevant demographic attributes.
Usage
Load the Dataset:

Open a Jupyter Notebook or Python script to begin exploring and analyzing the dataset.
Perform Data Preprocessing:

Inspect the dataset by checking for missing values, duplicate records, and irrelevant columns.
Clean and transform the data as needed (e.g., replace '?' with NaN, remove duplicates, etc.).
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions of columns like age, workclass, and salary.
Analyze correlations between different variables (e.g., age vs. salary, education vs. salary).
Data Preprocessing and Analysis
The project was structured around the following tasks:

Display the Top and Last 10 Rows of the Dataset:

View the first and last 10 rows to get an overview of the data.
Check the Shape of the Dataset:

Examine the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
Get Dataset Information:

Investigate the data types of each column and check for memory usage.
Fetch a Random Sample:

Analyze a random sample (50%) of the dataset to get a diverse view of the data.
Handle Missing Data:

Check for and handle missing values in the dataset, replacing '?' with NaN and dropping rows with missing values.
Remove Duplicates:

Check and remove any duplicate entries in the dataset.
Generate Summary Statistics:

Summarize key statistics about the dataset, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation.
Drop Irrelevant Columns:

Drop columns like education-num, capital-gain, and capital-loss that may not be necessary for further analysis.
Explore the Distribution of the Age Column:

Visualize the distribution of the age column to identify the age groupings.
Analyze Persons with Age Between 17 and 48:

Identify how many individuals fall within the age range of 17 to 48.
Analyze the Distribution of the Workclass Column:
Visualize the distribution of workclass types (e.g., Private, Self-Employed).
Analyze Education and Degree Levels:
Investigate how many individuals have a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree.
Perform Bivariate Analysis:
Analyze relationships between variables such as age and salary, or education and salary.
Replace Salary Values with Binary Values:
Transform the salary column to binary values (0 for <=50K and 1 for >50K).
Workclass with the Highest Salary:
Identify which workclass category is associated with the highest average salary.
Gender and Salary Comparison:
Analyze which gender has a higher chance of earning a salary greater than 50K.
Convert workclass to Categorical Type:
Convert the workclass column to a categorical datatype to optimize performance and memory usage.
Results
The results of the analysis are summarized below:

Age Distribution: The age distribution of individuals is concentrated within specific ranges, with the majority of people falling between the ages of 25 and 50.

Workclass Distribution: Most individuals are employed in the private sector, followed by other categories like self-employment.

Salary Prediction: A strong relationship was found between education level and salary, with individuals with higher educational attainment more likely to earn above 50K annually.

Gender and Salary: Males generally have a higher chance of earning more than 50K annually, but there is also a notable number of females in higher-paying positions.

Key Insights: Certain workclass types like Self-Employed and Government were found to be more likely associated with higher salaries.
